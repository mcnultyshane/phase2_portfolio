# Shane McNulty's Professional Portfolio

## Project Description

This project was designed to build my first professional portfolio.  This portfolio will begin to be a showcase of my progress thoughout my time at the Penn Boot Camp as well as other professional achievements I am looking to highlight.  Although not currently lush in content, my expectations are to have this portfolio filled with many dynamic examples of code and applications for you all to review.

This HTML and CSS code was all built from scratch.  Our team was working off of an image provided by our instructor for the page's layout.  We were looking to achive a responsive display and modeled design to the web page.
