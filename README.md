# Shane McNulty's Professional Portfolio

## Project Description

This project was designed for the students of our coding boot camp to update their first professional portfolio and bring the design into a new iteration.  This portfolio is a showcase of my progress thoughout my time at the Penn Boot Camp as well as other professional achievements I am looking to highlight.  Although not currently as lush in content, my expectations are to have this portfolio filled with many dynamic examples of code and applications for you all to review.

This HTML and CSS code was all built with the aid of some web languages and styles available for web developers.  I implemented some new practice with Bulma.io for some of the styling along with Googlefonts We were looking to achive a responsive display and modeled design to the web page.
